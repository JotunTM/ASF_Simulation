\chapter{Methodology}
\label{c:methodology}

	This chapter describes the methodology used to find the optimum configurations of the ASF. To study the electricity generation and building energy consumption, a 3D geometry of the room and solar facade is built using the Rhinoceros software \cite{Rhino}, and its parametric modelling plugin Grasshopper \cite{grasshopper}. The aquired data is then post-processed in Python \cite{python} to extract the configurations that minimise building energy consumption and maximise PV electricity production.

	\section{Building Energy Analysis}

		The building energy simulation is conducted using EnergyPlus \cite{energyplus} through the DIVA \cite{DIVA} interface. In EnergyPlus, the geometric solar facade is interpreted as an external shading system. Simulations are performed for a whole year at fixed angle positions, outputing hourly values of energy use for heating, cooling and lighting. Optimum positions can then be found by comparing the electricity deman during every hour for all combinations. 

	\section{Radiation and PV Analysis}

		A solar radiance simulation is run using Ladybug \cite{roudsari2014ladybug},  which uses Radiance \cite{ward1994radiance} to determine the incident insolation on the solar facade. The approach enables to calculate solar irradiance on the modules with high spatial resolution including the effect of module mutual shading as seen in Figure \ref{fig:radiation}. The radiation is analysed for cumulative monthly hours for the whole year. The results are afterwards coupled to an electrical circuit simulation of thin-film PV modules with sub-cell level representation \cite{hofer2015PVSEC}. PV electricity production is calculated based on a reference module. The model includes temperature dependency and irradiation dependency. The temperature is estimated as suggested in \cite{Ross_Smokler_1986} with the following equation:

		\begin{equation}
			T_{cell} = T_{air} + \left(\frac{T_{cell}^0-T_{air}^0}{S^0}\right)S_{cell}
      		\label{e:temp}
		\end{equation}

		where $T_{cell}$ is the temperature of each grid point on the module, $T_{air}$ is the ambient temperature, $T_{cell}^0$ is the temperature of the cell at reference insolation $S^0=800\frac{W}{m^2}$ and reference air temperature $T_{air}^0=20\degree C$, and $S_{cell}$ is the insolation of each gridpoint in $\frac{W}{m^2}$. The value of $T_{cell}^0$ was estimated using thermal images of the solar facade and typical values given in \cite{Ross_Smokler_1986}.

		The electrical model of the PV cells builds up on the methodology presented in \cite{hofer2015PVSEC} which is using the standard equivalent circuit model to calculate sub-cell I-V curves with a single diode, one series and one shunt resistance \cite{mermoud2010}. 

	\section{Combined Evaluation}
		To combine the results of the building energy and the pv analysis, the building energy results were cumulatively combined to correspond to the pv analyis format. With this, the net energy useage of the room including the PV electricity production of the ASF can be given for monthly hours as described in equation \ref{e:minimize}. 

	\section{Simulation Framework}
		Building energy simulations are achieved by using DIVA, wheras a radiation analysis is done with LadyBug, both within Grasshopper for Rhino. The results are then fed into a python script, which calculates the electricity production based on the radiation results and the surrounding temperature and post processes the information to calculate energy demand and optimum configurations. A corresponding workflow can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:workflow}.

	\section{Case Study}
		%The case study is done for a room and facade representing the prototype of the ASF at the house of natural resources (HONR) \cite{honr}.  The solar facade consists of 400mm CIGS square panels that can rotate in two degrees of freedom. On the horizontal axis, the panels can move from 0$^{\circ}$ (closed) to 90$^{\circ}$ (open) position in steps of 22.5$^{\circ}$. In the vertical axis, it can move from 45$^{\circ}$ to -45$^{\circ}$ in 22.5$^{\circ}$ steps. Existing ASF systems \cite{nagy2015frontiers} have independently actuated panels and a continuous range of actuation, however for simplicity, we group all panels into one cluster that moves in unison. This leaves us with 25 possible dynamic configurations of the facade system.

		The office environment is heated with a heatpump with an average COP of 4 and cooled with an average COP of 3. When required, the electric lighting consumption is 11.7 $W/m^2$. 

		%A simulation of each possible dynamic configuration of the facade is run for each hourly timestep of the year using using a weather file for Kloten, Switzerland. %\cite{genevaweatherfile}. %The results are then post-processed in Python \cite{python} to extract the configurations that minimise building energy consumption and maximise PV electricity production.

		Simulations are run for different angle combinations, with a weather file for Kloten, Switzerland. The base case for the simulations consists of 25 angle combinations (five azimuth and 5 altitude angles), evaluated for averaged days of every month. The base-case scenario is then compared to control strategies where the angles are fixed or follow sun tracking and the sensitivity of various parameters, such as building orientation and COP.
