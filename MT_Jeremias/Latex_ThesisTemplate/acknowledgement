\chapter*{Acknowledgement}
This master thesis represents the last building stone of my master's education at ETH Zurich. Therefore, I would like to sincerely thank everyone, who has supported me throughout my studies. First of all, I want to thank my supervisor Prageeth Jayathissa, who has been greatly supporting me during this thesis. I also want to express my gratitude to Prof. Dr. Arno Schlueter, for giving me the opportunity to write my thesis within the A/S Group. Also, I would like to thank Johannes Hofer, who was extremely helpful with radiation evaluations and photovoltaic simulations, as well as various general discussions on other simulations and their results. Furthermore, I want to acknowledge everyone in the A/S team, I had many interesting discussions and conversations with all of the group members. Finally, I would like to thank my family and friends, for supporting my at all times - without them, I wouldn't have made it to where I am now.
