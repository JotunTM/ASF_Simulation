\chapter*{Abstract}
With building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV), dynamic shading systems and adaptive envelopes becoming increasingly important in new buildings, the adaptive solar facade (ASF) project, which combines a dynamic shading system with photovoltaic (PV) cells, is providing a promising technology for the future in building technology. This work presents a methodlolgy to simultaniously calculate the building energy demand and the PV electricity production of a building with PV modules as adaptive building shading system. A parametric model was built for dynamic evaluations and optimisations of such a system. A case study was then performed on a model representing the prototype of the ASF at the house of natural resources at the campus of ETH Zurich. It was possible to find the optimizing configurations of such a system as well as the corresponding building energy demand. Furthermore various influences were evaluated including sensitivities on the orientation, the location, the control strategy, and the building system parameters. For the chosen base case evaluation, energy benefits of 9\% compared to a fixed solar facade at the most beneficial angle, could be achieved through the optimization of the angle actuation. The corresponding PV electricity output is able to compensate for 41\% of the total building energy. The benefits are even larger for warmer regions than Zurich, as well as for buildings that have less efficient heating and cooling.
