\section{Building Energy Analysis}
\label{s:buildingResults}
	
	The optimal configurations of the ASF can be visualised using carpet-plots. For a classical building analysis this was done for every hour of the year. Figures \ref{f:DIVAx} and \ref{f:DIVAy} show the optimizing altitude and azimuth angles for heating, cooling, lighting and total building energy demand. In figure \ref{f:DIVAx}, darker colours represent closed positions, whereas brighter colours correspond to open positions. To optimize heating and lighting, open positions (corresponding to large altitude angles) are favourable, cooling is optimized by using closed positions (corresponding to small altitude angles). The overall optimized solutions follow the corresponding patterns at the hours of importance. The azimuth angles in figure \ref{f:DIVAy} correspond to the deviation from the facade normal. For a south facing facade, this means an angle with a positive sign represents the panels facing towards south-east (bright colours), whereas negative angles represent the panels facing towards south-west (dark colours). It can be seen that for heating and lighting, the facade takes positions that let the sun in, whereas for cooling the facade follows a sun-tracking pattern which prevents radiation to enter the room.

	Figure \ref{f:DIVAe} depicts the corresponding energy demand of the building for the whole year corresponding to the optimum positions presented in figures \ref{f:DIVAx} and \ref{f:DIVAy}. It can be seen that the heating heating is most needed during the winter and in the morning, whereas cooling is mainly apparent in summer afternoons. Lighting on the other hand is most important in the evenings and at times where there is not much sun. In the combined plot, this behavior be seen clearly as well, the main overlaps of different building energy consumptions take place during winter between heating and lighting in the morning and in the evening, and between cooling and lighting during summer evenings.

\section{Tradeoffs Between Different Optimisation Strategies}
	
	In order to visualize the tradeoffs between the different optimisation strategies, figures were created that show the influence of the different optimisation strategies on heating (figure \ref{f:tradeoff_H}), cooling (figure \ref{f:tradeoff_C}), lighting (figure \ref{f:tradeoff_L}), PV electricity (figure \ref{f:tradeoff_PV}), total building energy (figure \ref{f:tradeoff_HCL}) and net energy (figure \ref{f:tradeoff_E_tot}). Optimisation strategies were evaluated for heating (H), cooling (C), lighting (L), photovoltaic (PV), building energy demand (HCL), net energy demand (E\_tot), a combination of PV and cooling, and a fixed facade at a $45\degree$ altitude angle. The results from sections \ref{s:actuation} and \ref{s:tradeoffs} can be visualized here in more detail. It can clearly be seen, that while the cooling demand and the PV electricity production are strongly influenced by the actuation and the optimisation strategy, the lighting and heating have less fluctuations within the energy performance.
