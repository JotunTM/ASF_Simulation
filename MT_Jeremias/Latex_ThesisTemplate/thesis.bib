During the life of the FSA Project, these activities were known by and included a variety of evolving organizational titles: Design and Test, Large-Scale Procurements, Engineering, Engineering Sciences, Operations, Module Performance and Failure Analysis, and at the end of the Project, Reliability and Engineering Sciences.

We identified two other corrections (recombination losses and spectral correction) in order to improve the modelling of amorphous technology modules.

But in other way, they can decrease the visual comfort and increase the energy consumption of artificial lighting. Actually, the sizing of shading devices is mainly a thermal optimization process. The efficacy of solar shades must be assess taking into account both thermal and visual point of view. In this paper simple indices were proposed to compare the thermal and visual efficacy of different types of solar shadings in non-residential buildings. These indices can be derived from the results of numerical simulations that include thermal and daylighting analysis such as the EnergyPlus software. A typical office is studied in order to assess the efficacy of different types of solar protections. The use of the proposed indices made obvious the choice and the sizing of the most efficient solar shade for the case study. },

  abstract = {Abstract This paper presents the results of three methods that measure energy produced by photovoltaic (PV) modules integrated in various external opaque shadings of typical office buildings in Greece. These methods are related to the comparison of energy production results by three different models: a simple energy computer simulation model that uses the theoretical average \{PV\} efficiency of 12%, a more complete computer simulation model using detailed equations (using either theoretical or real \{PV\} Market products), and real \{PV\} installations. The paper addresses the problem of designing efficient shading devices for buildings. Each examined method refers to a different design stage according to the level of information that is available to the designer. The results showed that the simple simulation and the more elaborated models have similar performance for most of the shading devices, apart from those with a complicated geometry. Moreover, the complete model that uses parameters of \{PV\} modules already available on the market can provide results of energy production even for complicated geometries. It is also concluded that the real \{PV\} installations produce results very close to the theoretical average \{PV\} efficiency of 12%. },

  abstract = {The shading-type building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) claddings can act as power generators as well as external shading devices of a building, which reduce the energy consumption of the building. However, there is little information about energy impacts of different tilt angles of the shading-type \{BIPV\} claddings. By considering the typical meteorological conditions of Hong Kong, the energy performance of the shading-type \{BIPV\} claddings, in terms of the electricity generation and the cooling load reduction, is analyzed in this paper. The optimum tilt angle of \{PV\} modules for maximum electricity generation is found to be 20° instead of local latitude. Combining electricity generation and cooling load reduction, it can be concluded that the optimum tilt angles for the first type of the shading-type \{BIPV\} claddings vary from 30° to 50°, while the optimum tilt angle for the second type is 0°. },

  abstract = {The shading-type \{BIPV\} claddings can act as power generators as well as external shading devices and insulation panels. There is little available information about the impacts of orientations and inclinations on the combined energy effects of the shading-type \{BIPV\} claddings, including the power output of \{PV\} modules, the cooling load reduction of windows and concrete walls. It is worth studying the effects of different shading-type \{BIPV\} cladding designs on the total energy saving in order to maximize the system’s energy performance. By considering the meteorological conditions in Hong Kong, the energy effect of the shading-type \{BIPV\} claddings with different surface azimuth angles, in terms of electricity generation and cooling energy consumption reduction is analyzed in this paper. Based on the investigations, the optimum design of the shading-type \{BIPV\} claddings for different orientations can be achieved. },

  abstract = {Shading systems improve building energy performance and occupant comfort by controlling glare, natural lighting, and solar gain. Integrating PV (photovoltaics) in shading systems opens new opportunities for BIPV (building integrated photovoltaics) on façades. A key problem of such systems is mutual shading among PV modules as it can lead to electrical mismatch losses and overheating effects. In this work, we present a new modeling framework, which couples parametric 3D with high-resolution electrical modeling of thin-film PV modules to simulate electric energy yield of geometrically complex PV applications. The developed method is able to predict the shading pattern for individual PV modules with high spatio-temporal resolution, which is of great importance for electrical system design. The methodology is applied to evaluate the performance of different dynamic BIPV shading system configurations, as well as its sensitivity to façade orientation and module arrangement. The analysis shows, that there is a trade-off between tracking performance and mutual shading of modules. Distance between modules is a critical parameter influencing the amount of mutual shading and hence limiting solar irradiation and electricity generation of PV shading systems using solar tracking. Planning of module string configuration, PV cell orientation, and location of bypass diodes according to partial shading conditions, reduces electrical mismatch losses and results in significantly higher electricity generation. The integration of parametric 3D and electrical modeling opens new possibilities for PV system design and dynamic control optimization. Though the analysis focuses on BIPV, the method is useful for the planning and operation of solar tracking systems in general.},
