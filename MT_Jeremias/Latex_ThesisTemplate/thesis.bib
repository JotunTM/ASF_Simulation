These activities included: (1) development of functional, safety, and reliability requirements for such applications; (2) development of the engineering analytical approaches, test techniques, and design solutions required to meet the requirements; (3) synthesis and procurement of candidate designs for test and evaluation; and (4) performance of extensive testing, evaluation, and failure analysis to define design shortfalls and, thus, areas requiring additional research and development. During the life of the FSA Project, these activities were known by and included a variety of evolving organizational titles: Design and Test, Large-Scale Procurements, Engineering, Engineering Sciences, Operations, Module Performance and Failure Analysis, and at the end of the Project, Reliability and Engineering Sciences.

We found that for any module an exponential behaviour of the shunt resistance parameter should be taken into account. We identified two other corrections (recombination losses and spectral correction) in order to improve the modelling of amorphous technology modules. These improvements have been implemented in the PVsyst software developed at the University of Geneva.},

But in other way, they can decrease the visual comfort and increase the energy consumption of artificial lighting. Actually, the sizing of shading devices is mainly a thermal optimization process. The efficacy of solar shades must be assess taking into account both thermal and visual point of view. In this paper simple indices were proposed to compare the thermal and visual efficacy of different types of solar shadings in non-residential buildings. These indices can be derived from the results of numerical simulations that include thermal and daylighting analysis such as the EnergyPlus software. A typical office is studied in order to assess the efficacy of different types of solar protections. The use of the proposed indices made obvious the choice and the sizing of the most efficient solar shade for the case study. },

  abstract = {Abstract This paper presents the results of three methods that measure energy produced by photovoltaic (PV) modules integrated in various external opaque shadings of typical office buildings in Greece. These methods are related to the comparison of energy production results by three different models: a simple energy computer simulation model that uses the theoretical average \{PV\} efficiency of 12%, a more complete computer simulation model using detailed equations (using either theoretical or real \{PV\} Market products), and real \{PV\} installations. The paper addresses the problem of designing efficient shading devices for buildings. Each examined method refers to a different design stage according to the level of information that is available to the designer. The results showed that the simple simulation and the more elaborated models have similar performance for most of the shading devices, apart from those with a complicated geometry. Moreover, the complete model that uses parameters of \{PV\} modules already available on the market can provide results of energy production even for complicated geometries. It is also concluded that the real \{PV\} installations produce results very close to the theoretical average \{PV\} efficiency of 12%. },

However, there is little information about energy impacts of different tilt angles of the shading-type \{BIPV\} claddings. By considering the typical meteorological conditions of Hong Kong, the energy performance of the shading-type \{BIPV\} claddings, in terms of the electricity generation and the cooling load reduction, is analyzed in this paper. The optimum tilt angle of \{PV\} modules for maximum electricity generation is found to be 20° instead of local latitude. Combining electricity generation and cooling load reduction, it can be concluded that the optimum tilt angles for the first type of the shading-type \{BIPV\} claddings vary from 30° to 50°, while the optimum tilt angle for the second type is 0°. },

  abstract = {The shading-type \{BIPV\} claddings can act as power generators as well as external shading devices and insulation panels. There is little available information about the impacts of orientations and inclinations on the combined energy effects of the shading-type \{BIPV\} claddings, including the power output of \{PV\} modules, the cooling load reduction of windows and concrete walls. It is worth studying the effects of different shading-type \{BIPV\} cladding designs on the total energy saving in order to maximize the system’s energy performance. By considering the meteorological conditions in Hong Kong, the energy effect of the shading-type \{BIPV\} claddings with different surface azimuth angles, in terms of electricity generation and cooling energy consumption reduction is analyzed in this paper. Based on the investigations, the optimum design of the shading-type \{BIPV\} claddings for different orientations can be achieved. },
