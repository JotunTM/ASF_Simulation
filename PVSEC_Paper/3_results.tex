The results can be visualised using carpet-plots. Figure \ref{fig:carpetplot} details carpet-plots of the facade optimised to maximise PV generation, and minimise heating, cooling and lighting demands independently. We can see how open configurations (light coloured) are chosen to minimise the building heating demands during the winter months and early mornings of spring and autumn. Likewise closed configurations (dark colours) are the preferred solution to minimise the cooling demand during the winter months. Lighting control is only apparent during the twilight hours where the facade exists in an open position. The PV optimisation [write as data comes in]...

When the four optimisation cases are combined to achieve the configurations for total energy minimisation we get some interesting results. There is a conflict in the summer evenings between minimising lighting and cooling demands. Likewise, we also see a conflict between heating and PV production during the summer months....

The overall energy consumption, including PV generation is compared with static cases is sumarised in Table XX.
