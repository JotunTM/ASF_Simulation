In this paper we present a simulation methodology to evaluate a dynamic photovoltaic shading system, combining both electricity generation, and the energy demand on the building. The methodology can be applied to evaluate different PV systems, building systems, building typologies and climates. It is then coupled with a post processing python script to determine the optimum system configuration for control. 

The dynamic PV integrated shading system has clear advantages to a static system as it can adapt itself to the external environmental. This enables it to find the balance of the most energy efficient position, resulting in savings of XX\% compare to an equivalent static system. The choice of an open or closed configuration in areas of conflicting interests are sensitive to the building system and location. The use of LED lights for example reduces the importance of the lighting energy demand. Closed configurations that reduce cooling begin to overpower the open configurations. Likewise a highly efficient cooling system will give preference to open positions during these conflicting times. 

The work presented in this paper is applied in the context of the Adaptive Solar Fa√ßade (ASF) project. The ASF is a lightweight PV shading system that can be easily installed on any surface of new or existing buildings. The ASF consists of a modular frame and pneumatically actuated panels to control glare and solar gain, as well as for two-axis PV tracking. It has been implemented at the ETH House of Natural Resources will be installed at the NEST HiLo building at EMPA (www.hilo.arch.ethz.ch).
