Building energy demand could be minimized, while the PV electricity production could be maximized. Generally it can be said that for heating and lighting, open positions are favorable whereas closed positions are needed for cooling and PV electricity production. As the PV electricity production is strongly dependent on the self-shading of the facade, the positions that optimize PV electricity production do not match a sun-tracking pattern, as longitudinal shading has to be minimized. Therefore angles need to be chosen, that would be less efficient for a single module without self shading, but are minimizing the longitudinal self shading on the panels.
