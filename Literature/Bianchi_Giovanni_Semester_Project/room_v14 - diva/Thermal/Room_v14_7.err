   ** Warning ** CalcSurfaceCentroid: 1 Surfaces have the Z coordinate < 0.
   **   ~~~   ** ...in any calculations, Wind Speed will be 0.0 for these surfaces.
   **   ~~~   ** ...in any calculations, Outside temperatures will be the outside temperature + 9.750E-003 for these surfaces.
   **   ~~~   ** ...that is, these surfaces will have conditions as though at ground level.
   ************* Note that the following warning(s) may/will occur if you have not enclosed your zone completely.
   ** Warning ** Entered Zone Volumes differ from calculated zone volume(s).
   **   ~~~   ** ...use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings; to show more details on individual zones.
   ** Warning ** CheckUsedConstructions: There are 25 nominally unused constructions in input.
   **   ~~~   ** For explicit details on each unused construction, use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings;
   ** Warning ** Calculation of reflected solar onto surface=EP_WALL 0 may be inaccurate
   **   ~~~   ** because it has one or more vertices below ground level.
   ** Warning ** Calculation of reflected solar onto surface=EP_WINDOW 0 may be inaccurate
   **   ~~~   ** because it has one or more vertices below ground level.
   ** Warning ** Calculation of reflected solar onto surface=EP_FLOOR 0 may be inaccurate
   **   ~~~   ** because it has one or more vertices below ground level.

   ************* ===== Final Error Summary =====
   ************* The following error categories occurred.  Consider correcting or noting.
   ************* Nominally Unused Constructions
   ************* ..The nominally unused constructions warning is provided to alert you to potential conditions that can cause
   ************* ..extra time during simulation. Each construction is calculated by the algorithm indicated in the HeatBalanceAlgorithm
   ************* ..object. You may remove the constructions indicated (when you use the DisplayExtraWarnings option).
